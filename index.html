    <h1 id="title">Callums page of utter randomness</h1>
    <p id="note">Before diving into this webpage, understand that this is going to be page of me regurgitating random information about myself in no coherent logical order. Also I wouldn't recomend staying on this page for more than 10 mins as the horrid font gives you motion sickness.<br><br>
      Oh and heres a Giraffe to watch you on your pointless journey :)

      <h3 id="intro_title">Little introduction about myself</h3>
      <br>Now ill try and make this as quick as possible for 2 reasons here.... firstly today is the deadline for this and Im partly rushing, and it likely that you will get bored quickly!<br><br>
      So to beign with I am from Liverpool, my scouse accent often causes whoever I am discoursing with to assume im probably not that intelligent. I like to think ive got half a marble anyway!
      <br></br>
      My hobbies are sometimes everending, at least they they feel like it, but I dont have an issue with that. Through out my whole childhood ive managed to do well with any form of physical activity
      I put my hand to, so this trait often led me to give things up and move onto the next exciting activity. At the moment though I find my life being consumed by a handful of things... the gym, rock climbing, yoga/meditation & breathwork and last but certainly not leaste, programming and technology exploration!
      <br><br>
      I would highly recommend looking into some form of meditation/breathwork activities by the way, the long to short term benefits you recieve makes me believe that something like this is a no brainer
      for an individual with abit of spare time on their hands. I personally find that I benefit from a really calming and logical mindset but with the breathwork this can be easily accompanied by an awesome long lasting feeling of true happiness,
      amplified when you do these types of activies with a group ardent friends :).

      If it is then let me know as its likely I would have only read the first sentence or so.</p>
      <h3 id="random_title">The Forest Village Story (a story so written by me about me and cartainly not written and named by AI)</h3>
      <p class="story_font" id="random_story">Once upon a time, there was a small village nestled in the heart of a dense forest. The villagers lived a simple and happy life, relying on the forest for their livelihood. They hunted game, gathered berries and nuts, and fished the nearby rivers. The forest was also home to a wise old owl, who the villagers often sought advice from.<br><br>
        One day, the villagers noticed that the forest was becoming smaller and smaller, as trees were being chopped down to make room for farmland. The owl warned the villagers that if they did not act soon, the forest would be destroyed and they would lose their home. So, the villagers came together and worked to protect the forest, planting new trees and creating boundaries to keep the farmland from spreading. <br><br>
        Thanks to their hard work, the forest flourished once again, and the villagers lived happily ever after in the heart of their beautiful, thriving forest. The owl continued to watch over them, offering guidance and wisdom whenever it was needed. And so, the village and the forest lived in harmony for generations to come.
